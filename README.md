I am Giorgio Paulon, 1st year PhD student in Statistics at UT Austin. This is my personal page for the Statistical Modeling II class with Prof. James Scott.

## Exercise 1

- Bayesian updating in simple conjugate families
- Multivariate Normal distribution
- Classical principles of linear regression
- Frequentist approaches to uncertainty quantification
