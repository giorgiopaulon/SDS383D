# SDS 383D, Spring 2017

I am Giorgio Paulon, 1st year PhD student in Statistics at UT Austin. This is my personal page for the Statistical Modeling II class with Prof. James Scott.

## Exercise 1
In the [first homework](https://github.com/gpaulon/SDS383D/tree/master/HW1), we review some basics of:
- Bayesian updating in simple conjugate families
- Multivariate Normal distribution
- Classical principles of linear regression
- Frequentist approaches to uncertainty quantification

## Exercise 2
In the [second homework](https://github.com/gpaulon/SDS383D/tree/master/HW2), we study three different models:
- Conjugate Gaussian model with unknown mean and variance
- Conjugate Gaussian linear model
- Heavy tailed linear model (Student t residuals) for outlier detection

## Exercise 3
In the [third homework](https://github.com/gpaulon/SDS383D/tree/master/HW3), the main topic is nonlinear curve fitting. In particular, the classes of models we analyze are:
- Linear smoothers
- Local polynomial regression
- Gaussian processes for nonparametric regression and spatial smoothing
